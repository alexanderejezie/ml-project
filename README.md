# What I'm Aiming For

1. Dataset Selection:
  - Head over to Kaggle and choose a dataset that aligns with your interests. Ensure it involves either a classification or regression task.
  - Real-world data can be messy, and that's perfectly fine! You're here to tame it.
2. Data Preprocessing:
  - Identify and handle missing values within your dataset. Employ effective strategies for dealing with missing data.
  - Implement data cleaning, formatting, and organization to prepare your dataset for training.
3. Feature Engineering:
  - Enhance your model's performance by creating new features or transforming existing ones.
  - Tailor your feature engineering techniques to address the specific needs of your chosen project.
4. Data Visualization:
  - Utilize data visualization techniques to gain insights into your dataset.
  - Create visualizations that reveal patterns and relationships, aiding your understanding of the data.
5. Model Selection:
  - Choose the right model based on the nature of your problem.
  - Consider factors such as the task type (classification or regression), dataset size, and alignment with algorithm assumptions.
6. Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate your model's performance using appropriate metrics for the chosen task (accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices).
  - Use appropriate methods: hyper parameter tuning, cross validation, etc.
  - Justify your model selection and discuss the implications of your results.

# Instructions
- What dataset did you use?
- Explain your project! I want to see the thinking behind the code essentially.
e.g. why this project interested you, the steps you took while doing the project, how you decided what model to use.
